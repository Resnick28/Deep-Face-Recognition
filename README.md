# Deep Face Recognition Project
This project is organized by the Analytics Club of IIT Bombay under the mentorship of P Balasubramanian. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of deep face recognition using state-of-the-art neural network architectures and techniques. The mentor divided the project into several tasks, each of which helped us gain a better understanding of the field and develop our skills in implementing deep face recognition models.

## Task 1: Completing Coursera Courses
The first task of the project was to go through two Coursera courses: "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" and "Convolutional Neural Networks".
These courses provided a strong foundation in the concepts of neural networks and deep learning, which are crucial for understanding the workings of deep face recognition models.
We learned about the basic building blocks of neural networks, such as activation functions, backpropagation and gradient descent, as well as more advanced concepts like convolutional neural networks, which are widely used in image classification tasks.
Additionally, the course provided hands-on experience with implementing neural networks using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
## Task 2: Understanding How to Read Machine Learning Research Papers
The second task of the project was to understand how to read machine learning research papers by watching a video of Andrew Ng explaining how to read papers.
This task helped us understand the importance of reading research papers in order to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and to gain a deeper understanding of the techniques used in state-of-the-art models.
We learned about the structure of research papers, how to critically evaluate the methodologies and results, and how to identify the key contributions of a paper.
Additionally, we also learned how to use research papers as a starting point for our own projects and how to properly cite them in our work.
## Task 3: Reading Research Papers
Using the knowledge gained from the previous tasks, we read and understood several research papers that dealt with deep face recognition.
The papers we read included ResNet, InceptionNet, MobileNet v2, DeepFace, FaceNet, NormFace, and ArcFace.
These papers provided an in-depth look at various architectures and techniques used in deep face recognition models.
By reading these papers, we gained a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art in deep face recognition and the challenges that still need to be addressed.
## Task 4: Implementing Face Recognition using FaceNet
The next task was to understand how to implement face recognition using FaceNet.
This task involved coding and implementing the FaceNet model, which helped us understand the details of how the model works and how to train it.
We also learned about the different components of the model, such as the embedding network, the triplet loss function, and the classification layer.
This task helped us gain hands-on experience with building deep face recognition models and understand the details of how they work.
## Task 5: Coding for Triplet Losses
Along with implementing FaceNet, we also coded for triplet losses.
Triplet losses are widely used in deep face recognition models and this task helped us understand how they work and how to implement them in our model.
We learned about the different types of triplet losses, such as batch-hard and semi-hard triplet losses, and how they affect the training of the model.
By implementing the triplet loss function, we gained a deeper understanding of how the model learns to recognize faces.
## Task 6: Building a Face Recognition Model
The final task of the project was to build a face recognition model using the knowledge and skills gained from the previous tasks. This task involved using the techniques and architectures learned from the research

# Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of deep face recognition and its underlying concepts. By going through the various tasks, we were able to gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art architectures and techniques. Additionally, by reading research papers and implementing models from scratch, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the field. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for me.

# Usage
The code for this project is available in this repository. To run the code, you will need to have a dataset of images to train and test the model on. You will also need to have the necessary dependencies installed, such as TensorFlow and Keras.
